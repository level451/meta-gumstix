+ * This device tree is for AMOLED touchscreen RM67120 from Gumstix including 
+ * OSD055A-MIPI-DSI (DSI display) and GT1151 (touchscreen controller)
+ *
+ * Since the dragonboard has single DSI interface DSI0, so either HDMI or
+ * DSI interface locate at High Speed Connector would work
+ * In here, the adv_bridge is disabled (HDMI bridge), and linked the dsi0_out_ts
+ * to panel0_in
+ * 
+ * Steps to make the HDMI working again are:
+ * 1. Change the status to "ok" at adv_bridge and "disable" at panel@0
+ * 2. Turn on the "HDMI SEL" at switch S6 on Dragonboard-410c to overwrite the
+ *    DSI_SW_SEL GPIO32
